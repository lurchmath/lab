  ➤ "Theorem 10.47: The composition of injectives is injective."
	{ Assume f:A→B :g:B→C 
		:f is injective 
		:g is injective 
		g∘f is injective 
	}

	➤ "Proof:"
	{ Assume f:A→B :g:B→C 
		Assume f is injective  :g is injective
		g∘f:A→C
		{ Let x,y be such that (g∘f)(x)=(g∘f)(y)
      
			  g(f(x)) = (g∘f)(x)
			          = (g∘f)(y)
			  			  = g(f(y))
      
		  f(x)=f(y)
			x = y

		g∘f is injective
