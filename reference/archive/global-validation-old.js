//  Global n-compact Validation
//
//  (KEEP OUT!  Work in progress.)
//
//  This file is still under construction and subject to frequent change. It
//  contains all of the infrastructure, surrounding utilities, and other content
//  needed for the testing and design modifications for a global n-compact
//  validation tool.  Currently it is in a separate file that is only imported
//  when using Lode, the node LDE app, to keep it separate from the more
//  thoroughly tested code in the LDE repo.  Use this code at your own risk.
//
// TODO Summary: 
// * For each attribute we use below, decide whether it should be stored cached
//   as a permanent LC attribute or a normal js object attribute before moving
//   to the repo.
// * Optimizations: for a rule like symmetry of equality, it will ALWAYS be
//   instantiated twice for every equation in the user's doc.  Figure some way
//   to improve that situation in general.
// * Eliminate or replace BIHs. 
//   * Add "Consider" options that are force-matched to lone metavariable and
//     EFAs.
//   * When an EFA has a parameter that is partially instantiated, leverage that
//     by allowing it to match expressions that contain the partial
//     instantiations.
//   * Along these lines, one 'strategy' is to consider 'BIH-makers', namely
//     what kinds of natural, minimal things can a user enter when doing, say,
//     substitution, that would be a tiny enough hint that Lurch could construct
//     an entire BIH from it?
// * Consider speeding up matching in several ways.
//   * Allow an option to eliminate the constant lambda expression as a
//     solution.
//   * Allow an option to efficiently solve 'Weenie' matching problems. e.g., if
//     (@ P c) where P is a metavar and c is a constant is matched to e, and e
//     does not contain c, return the constant solution (or none if the previous
//     option is enabled).  If e only has one instance of c, there's only one
//     solution, so return that without recursing.  If it has two instances
//     there are four solutions, so return those.  Three have eight.  That
//     should cover about 99% of the cases.
// * Design a generic way to use multiple validation tools in the same document
//   so they work well together.  For example, to have a CAS rule work with this
//   501 validation tool we might insert a placeholder formula like `:{ CASRule
//   }` and when an expression is supposed to be validated by the CAS rule it
//   can put 'instantiations' after that formula to make a valid CAS expression
//   validate propositionally.
// * The following algorithm makes several passes through the entire document to
//   process each step/phase separately for testing and experimenting. It might
//   be more efficient to make one pass through the entire document, modifying
//   everything as you go. Update: initial benchmarks seem to indicate that ALL
//   of the computation time is coming from finding all of the instantiations,
//   so this probably doesn't matter.  Furthermore, initial tests seem to
//   indicate that that in an interactive UI almost everything this algorithm
//   does will be almost instantaneous.  So optimization would mainly only
//   affect batch mode instantiation of a large document from scratch.
//
// * Sometimes an instantiation will instantiate the variable in a Let with a
//   constant, either directly or indirectly, e.g. `Let 0'`. This doesn't seem
//   to hurt anything but it makes for stupid instantiations, and might speed
//   things up if we eliminate it.
// * For rules like transitivity, e.g. :{ :x=y y=z x=z }, if used successfully
//   they get instantiated six times, once for each pair of metavariables, but
//   produce the same instantiation, plus a lot more.  However, these rules do
//   not have a forbidden expression like the metavar W or (@ P x), so they
//   don't automatically require a BIH.  But it is clearly nice to have such
//   rules.  So add an attribute marking it as 'inefficient', and treat Rule or
//   Part containing only a forbidden W or (@ P x) as a special case of
//   'inefficient' so that in every case a BIH is required.
// * Make a substitution tool that does the following. 
//   - find any expressions of the form A~B (i.e., (~ A B)) where ~ is a
//     reflexive relation like =. ≤ etc, and A and B are expressions.
//   - compute the expression diff() between A and B, and see if there is a
//     nontrivial possible substitution, e.g. X=Y, that when applied to A~A
//     would produce A~B via substitution.
//   - add the instantiations
//
//        :{ A~A }           (of the reflexive rule for ~)
//
//     and
//
//        :{ :X=Y :A~A A~B } (of the substitution rule for =)
//
//   - do this for all expressions of the form A~B in the document.  This gives
//     us the main logic behind substitution by skipping the annoying
//     substitution BIHs for propositional expressions of this form. 
//
//     TODO: make a similar tool for other common propositions to specify
//     substitutions, e.g. 
//
//       `Substituting x=y in ∀z,f(x,y)<z yeilds ∀z,f(y,y)<z`
//
//   - we may want to then add a special way to declare reflexive operators
//     rather than just inserting the various reflexive rules, e.g.,
//     reflexive_operator(=.≤,⊆)
// * Make a transitive chain tool that generalized the previous feature that
//   does the following.
//   - Allows a special kind of Declaration, e.g., trans_op_chain(=,≤,<) or
//     trans_op_chain(=,⊆) or trans_op_chain(⇔,⇒).  Note that not all such
//     operators are reflexive.
//   - Allows expressions that chain the operators in a single such declaration
//     of the form (E₀ op₁ E₁ op₂ ... opₙ Eₙ) where op₁,op₂,...,opₙ are all in a
//     single trans_op_chain declaration. Alternatively, this can be entered as
//     the sequence of expressions (E₀ op₁ E₁), (op₂ E₂), ...  (opₙ Eₙ), where
//     using the binary operators in prefix form indicates they should be
//     concatenated to the chain. 
//   - For each k from 1..n add the expression (Eₖ₋₁ opₖ Eₖ) to the pool of user
//     expressions to match, and apply the substitution tool for reflexive
//     operators to each such expression.
//   - After propositioall add validation after Eₖ if it eventually validates
//   - Add the following 'instantiation' to the list 
//
//         :{ :(E₀ op₁ E₁) :(E₁ op₂ E₂) ... :(Eₙ₋₁ opₙ Eₙ) (E₀ op Eₙ) ) }
//
//     where op is the last operator in any trans_op_chain containing
//     op₀,...,opₙ that appears among op₀,...,opₙ.  For efficiency we don't
//     insert every possible relation between the E's that are deducible from
//     this chain.  If the user wants to use more than one, they should make a
//     transitive chain for each one.
//
// New attributes for LCs used here 
// 
// TODO: these are out of date... go through the code and update eventually
//
// One immediately question that arises when defining all of these new
// attributes is whether they should be LC attributes or js attributes.  The
// design principle we will use to make this decision in each case is roughly
// the following. If the attribute is something that can always be computed from
// the LC or its context we store it as a js attribute.  If it is some inherent
// piece of information which sometimes cannot be computed on the fly, then we
// store it as an LC attribute.  The exception might be any computed attribute
// that we want to store with the user's document because it is expensive to
// recompute.
//
// The advantage to this approach is that we can easily refresh all of the
// computable attributes from scratch from the given user data e.g. after fixing
// a bug or testing a coding change.
//
//    LC attributes: Environments
//    * 'Rule' - (isA) this environment is a Formula which can be instantiated.
//    * 'BIH'  - (isA) this environment is a blatant instantiation hint supplied
//               by the user.
//
//    LC attributes: Declarations 
//    * 'Declare' - (isA) this declaration declares global constants and has no
//                  propositional form, whether a given or claim.
//
//    JS attributes: formula environments
//    * 'domain'   - the js Set of metavariable names (strings) in this formula 
//    * 'isWeeny'  - boolean that is true iff this formula is Weeny (has at
//                   least one metavariable and at least one Weeny expression 
//    * 'weenies'  - the array of Weeny expressions in this formula, if any 
//    * 'finished' - boolean that is true if this formula is finished being
//                   instantiated and should be ignored on future passes
//
//    JS attributes: user's document environment 
//    * 'userPropositions' - cache of the user's propositions (the e expressions
//      to match) stored in the last child of the document (the user's content)
//
//    JS attributes: instantiation environments & BIH's 
//    * 'instantiation' - boolean indicating that this is an instantiation with
//                        no metavars left
//    * 'creators'   - the user proposition(s) that caused this instantiation
//
//    JS attributes: declarations body copy and premature generalizations
//    * 'bodyOf'   - indicates an Expression is a copy of the body of a
//      declaration
//    * 'preemie'  - a expression that is justified by a Let that it is in the
//                   scope
//    * 'badBIH'   - an environment marked asA 'BIH' that isn't one
//
//    JS attributes - Symbols
//    * 'constant' - boolean that indicates whether a free symbol is explicitly
//      declared by a Let, Declare, or ForSome
//    * 'properName' - its value is the proper name of this Lurch symbol

// Validate
//
// Validate the target of this LC, store the result, and return true or false.
//
// This routine currently can use one or both of two validation tools: the
// propositional checker and the preemie checker.  The second and third optional
// arguments are booleans which specify whether it should be prop checked and
// preemie checked respectively.  This is useful for calling this efficiently
// from .validateall.  If both are false, it does nothing and returns undefined.)
//
// With both tools, in order for this to provide more localized information
// about what is wrong with a proof, everything that is accessible to the target
// is temporarily treated as a Given, so that the propositional validity of a
// target is not dependent on the propositional validity of the things
// accessible to it.  
//
// We assume that every instantiation that will be required for computing the
// prop form and propositional validation has already been added to the
// document.  Thus, other Validation Tools, like BIH, and CAS, which might
// create instantiations, need to be run on the entire document before this
// final step as part of the instantiation phase.
//
// There are also some validation checks that may not need to instantiate
// anything, like checking that Let-environments don't violate the 'preemie'
// restriction by validating them without the initial Let() and making sure they
// are still valid and ignoring all tick marks on non-constant variables in
// instantiations or that are in the scope of a deleted Let. This check only
// makes sense when a target is propositionally valid, but should not be valid
// because of violating the preemie condition. So we only need to check for
// preemies only after doing propositional validation, and then only check the
// valid inferences in the scope of a Let or containing a Let.
//
// Just as for propositional checking, when checking to see if the target is a
// preemie, we do not care if anything accessible to it is a preemie. Keep in
// mind that by ignoring Lets, some of the things accessible to it might have a
// different propositional form (no tick marks on some variables in addition to
// being givens), but since they are temporarily treated as givens, even if they
// are preemies themselves, they will not be flagged as such.
//
// For targets which are Expressions or ForSomes we only check the target to see
// if it is a preemie, regardless of whether there might be other preemies in
// the LC.  But when the target is an environment, we only check if it is a
// preemie by ignoring the Lets it is in the scope of and its own Let if it is
// a Let-env. Thus, this routine assumes that all descendant Let-environments of
// this environment have already been preemie-checked (which will be the case
// when .validateall has been called).  Thus, this routine will tell you if the
// target is, itself, a preemie, but not if contains any preemies if you don't
// check for those first.  So it could return 'valid' for an environment, which
// is useful for .validateall, but might be misleading if you don't interpret it
// correctly.
//
// Moral: use only for targets that do not contain any descendant
//        Let-environments, or just call .validateall for environments that do.

// Validate All
//
// Validate every claim in this LC, store the result, and return true or false.
// The optional second argument, if false tells it to do an ordinary
// propositional check but not check for preemies. This may be all that is
// needed in the case where the library or document doesn't contain any Lets and
// thus doesn't have to check for preemies.
//
// We do the propositional check efficiently as follows. First, check the entire
// document. If it's valid we are done and can mark everything valid. If not,
// frequently it will be the case that previous proofs were already valid, but
// the one we are working on isn't. So check the children of the document. The
// ones that are valid, mark everything inside them as valid. Then recurse in
// the children of any invalid proof until we reach just the individual
// conclusions that are invalid.
//
// If checkPreemies is true, we have to additionally check if any
// propositionally valid inferences were preemies or valid because they contain
// preemies.  This must only be checked after propositional validation is
// complete since it relies on those results to know what to check.
//
// We do the preemie check efficiently as follows.
// * If the target is not valid, we don't have to do anything.
// * If the target is valid and not an environment, we just call .validate on
//   the target with checkPreemies=true. Update the validation result of the
//   target and its valid ancestors if it is a preemie. 
// * If the target is a valid environment we do the following.  
//   - Get all top level Let-env descendants of X (those not nested inside
//     another Let-env descendant of X).  
//   - If any exist, call .validateall(-,true) on each of those recursively
//     until we reach one that has no Let-env descendants.
//   - for the base case of the recursion, when a Let environment is reached
//     that does not contain any Let-environment descendants, validate it with
//     checkPreemies=true, and follow the same algorithm as for the
//     Propositional check above (if it's preemie-valid we're done because
//     everything is already prop valid, and if any of the conclusions were
//     preemies the whole thing would be invalid. So if it's not preemie valid,
//     recurse into the environment tree to locate the individual preemies it
//     contains as for prop checking).
//   - when the recursion is complete, do the same check on the ancestor
//     Let-env, by omitting just it's own Let and the Let's it is in the scope
//     of, but not the ones that are descendants.  This will detect any
//     additional preemies that are descendants but not inside descendant
//     Let-envs. If any new ones are found or if one of the recursive checks
//     found a preemie, in either case mark them and the parent being checked as
//     invalid for reason 'contains preemie'.
//

//
// This routine returns an array of solutions. 
//
// Aside: Crude Attribute and matching documentation for quick reference
//
// We have the following situation regarding attributes in matching:
// 1) For atomic expressions, attributes matter.  That is, x with color=purple
//    is not the same as x with color=orange.
// 2) For non-atomic expressions, attributes do not matter, and matching is
//    defined only in terms of their children.  I could change this without too
//    much trouble if you prefer that it be changed for consistency.
// 3) When using the Formula namespace to match a formula against a possible
//    instance, then given vs. not given matters for both environments and
//    outermost expressions. No other attributes other than "given" are checked
//    when converting a formula-and-possible-instance pair into a matching
//    problem, but once it has been converted into one, then rules 1) and 2)
//    apply.
// 4) Although this should be 100% invisible to any user of the matching
//    package, and therefore 100% irrelevant, I will state it for completeness's
//    sake:  There are some de Bruijn attributes used internally by the matching
//    package to record the original symbol names, and those are (necessarily
//    and correctly) ignored during matching.
